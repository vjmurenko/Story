                lang=EN-US>Evgenia Alekseevna Mazalevskaya came to visit relatives in the
village for the summer. They were her uncle and her aunt by her husband, his
wife. The girl's mother died when her daughter was six years old, and her
father, the director of the gymnasium, lived alone in St. Petersburg. He was a
man of acrimony and cruelty, intolerant of other people's opinions, ambitious
and harsh, a strange combination of bureaucrat and liberal. In relation to his
daughter, he was a real Dombey, although the Slavic blood prevented him from
holding this brand quite. There is no doubt that he loved the girl as well as
she loved him, but on his side the love was irritable and despotic, demanding
obedience to his views; on her side it was simple, but withdrawn and proud, for
the old man never spoke directly, but only in intricate, rebus-like hints, and
could drive anyone into a frenzy with sudden turns from stingy gentleness to
gratuitous or at least unexplained bitterness. It was a hard, hurtful
relationship for a young girl. The reason for them lay, of course, in her
father's character, but this reason, as well as his inner life, was a secret to
Eugenia. She was constantly drawn to the relationship simple and cordial, but
many impressions of life have developed so that, having lost the clear
directness of the soul, she became withdrawn and fearful, inwardly silent, as
dazed from the unexpected insult of a man, and passed life with a sad distrust
of her, trying to be apart.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Of course, this pale city girl was glad to get away for a while from
the difficult relations with her father, from service (she served in the office
of the medical journal) and, smiling at the summer pleasures, went to her
uncle, whom she had seen once in her life. The uncle, a landowner, who suffered
constant failures in the cultivation of corn, peaches, Argentine cucumbers, and
other things ruinous to the northern pocket, absent-mindedly looked at his
niece over his spectacles with the naive eyes of a complacent nobleman, shoved
agricultural brochures into her hand, told her about strawberries, and in the
morning, with a newspaper in his hands, rubbing his forehead assiduously,
knocked at Eugenia's door. “Look here,” he said, as he entered, “the most
marvelous report: it turns out that in the Egyptian sphinx these devils, what
are their Belgians ... have opened a temple. What a marvel.” Seeing the man, he
suffered, wrinkled his nose and said “you”, to which the man respectfully
objected: “So you, father, Pal Palych, you'll have to take a bite out of the
vygonu, without that where is it?”. The manager, aka the headman of the village
church, stole as he wished. Pavel Pavlovich played the piano beautifully; while
playing, his face became businesslike and energetic. He did not like cities; he
used to serve in elections, but gave it up, saying, “What can you do with them
- they will turn as they wish.” His wife, Inna Sergeyevna, a languid, sickly,
lemon-colored face, a plump lady, could spend hours reminiscing about
Petersburg. The spouses sometimes quarrelled, in whispers, without passion,
with an annoying boredom in their hearts. Inna Sergeyevna, sighing, said to her
husband: “Pasha, I have given you everything, everything, - you are a narrow,
ungrateful man,” to which, wiping his sweating spectacles, Pavel Pavlovich
replied: “He who remembers the old, to him an eye out.” Guests, afraid of
boredom, went to them rarely and reluctantly.</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>Eugenia Alexeevna spent her time in walking, reading, thinking,
sleeping and eating. In two weeks she became noticeably better, pinker, a
healthy gleam appeared in her eyes. The lazy quiet of summer strengthened her.
At the same time the following happened in a provincial town of a neighboring
province.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Stepan Sotkin, a young man of the bourgeoisie, has returned home
after a long absence. He had served for three years, wherever and however he
had to, in various places in Russia: as a cashier on a steamship, as a weigher
at a station, as a conductor, and as an agent for a linen firm. He had not
corresponded with his parents for nearly a year, so that when he returned it
was a great and serious news to him that his elder brother had died, and Stepan
Sotkin had to draw lots. There were not many conscripts this year, the
preferential lot required exceptional happiness, and they could not reject
Sotkin, because he was a healthy, tall and fast man.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>In the evening there was a family tea-party in the garden under an
elderberry tree. Old Sotkin, a widower, a watchman of the state chamber, said:</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- “They'll take you away, Stepan. Grisha will die, and you'll get a

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- It is not yet known, - Stepan answered. - In fact, I have no
desire for military service.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>After four years of wandering he thought of the soldier's burden
with hatred and disgust. Since the age of sixteen Sotkin used to live quite
independently, moving from city to city, spending as he wished, his strength,
labor and money. He remembered the lively, colorful Moscow, the blue Volga, the
hum of the fair in Nizhny, the disorderly music of the Odessa port; in front of
him, shrouded in locomotive smoke, ran the forest. And Sotkin shook his head.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Yes, I don't feel like it,” he repeated.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- You can't jump higher than your ears,” said the old man. - Shall
we run away? To England. Two years and eight months - you'll get over it.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin sighed and went out for a wander and went into a pub. There,
clutching his head with his hands, he sat behind the bottles until closing time
and, having thoroughly discussed the situation, decided that he would have to
serve. Life abroad beckoned him, but also frightened him with the impossibility
of returning to Russia. “To serve is to serve,” he said, tossing some
breadcrumbs into his mouth, “so it will be.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>He was assigned to Penza. The usual bewilderment and confusion of
new recruits before the new conditions of life (most of them were “gray”
village boys), as well as their naive vanity, satisfied by the red new
epaulettes, the crack of the drum and music, were alien to Sotkin. As an
experienced and developed man, he quickly mastered all the simple wisdom of
stepping and twisting socks, dressing, eating superiors with his eyes, rifle
mechanism and - the so-called “diction”. Sotkin's smooth, calm character helped
him to avoid sharp clashes with non-commissioned officers and “old soldiers”,
who used to muzzle newcomers. He did not try to get promoted, but was executed.
All this did not prevent Sotkin's closest superiors - subplatoon, platoon,
fieldfebel and captenarmus (who usually plays the role of Iago among
non-commissioned officers; the warm, economic position of the captenarmus - the
object of envy - makes him a gossip, a schemer and a diplomat) - from treating
the young soldier coldly and disapprovingly.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>There is a breed of men to whom one might, modifying, refer
Goldsmith's words, “I am quite sure that no expression of submission will
restore me to freedom even for one hour.” Sotkin might have said, “No amount of
effort to be a model soldier will get me the favor of the non-commissioned
officers.”</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin belonged to the number of people who have the unfortunate
ability, when in dependence, to cause, without any care on their part, a
deafening and gratuitous enmity on the part of those on whom they depend. There
were no provinces of service and discipline behind him, but his inner attitude
to service, quite mechanical and indifferent, - his inability to ingratiate, to
get out, to flatter, to bend and flutter - was expressed, probably quite
unconsciously, in trifles: an occasional, close or quick glance, a smile, a
tone of voice, silence at the sharpness of the non-commissioned officer, calm
answers, quick movements. He cleaned the field-febel's boots without wrinkling
his nose, but only when ordered; others, rising early, worked with brushes with
an incomprehensible voluptuousness of obsequiousness. He, besides all this,
drank tea and white bread every day, and did not owe the marquis. The soldiers
respected him, and the petty authorities, with coldly glittering eyes, looked
at Sotkin with the misty, indifferent gaze of a cat contemplating the sparrows
in the air.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Such relations, of course, sooner or later, were bound to escalate
and come to light. The camp gathering came. Behind the Sura spread out white,
among green alleys, the tents of the O battalion. The soldiers, returning from
a training firing range, were bragging to each other about the accuracy of
their sights, dreaming of prize hours. Sotkin, shooting poorly, rarely
penetrated a target with more than two bullets out of five. The first shout of
the field officer: “Sotkin, look!” - and the second, “Raven, and still in the
first company!” made him aim more carefully and longer; however, more than
three bullets waved did not show him a red badge. A month later they switched
to movable targets.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>On a horizontal rotating pole, three hundred paces away, slowly showing
from the trench and disappearing, belted figures popped up. The platoon fired
lying down. The suffocating, fiery heat flowed over the field colorless
shimmers of air, the fly and the sighting frame glistened in the sun, beaming,
as the flame of a candle beams to a man squinting at it. Aiming was difficult.
In the distance, at eye level, dived, the size of a playing card, two-arch belt
targets.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin, holding his breath, took aim and let the target disappear in
order to shoot the next time it appeared.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The target reappeared. Sotkin fired, and the bullet, kicking up dust
far away, sang and drifted away. He wasted the other four cartridges, he didn't
hit.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Under the satchel, - said the company officer. Sotkin blushed
thickly and frowned. It was the first time he had to serve a sentence. Chagrin
and unreasonable shame seized him, as if he really, something dirty himself in
the eyes of others, but soon realized that the shame is only because he will
have to stand plastered in full marching gear for two hours, everyone will look
and at least mentally smile.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The company, having finished firing, with youthful songs about
“Major-General Alkhaz” and “spinning blue ball”, returned to the camp. Sotkin
was searched for by the platoon leader.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Sotkin,” he said indifferently, biting his lip, ”get dressed and
go to the ruler. The soldier, having listened to the order, returned to the
tent, hung up everything required by the regulations - manners, cartridges,
rolled up overcoat, bag, took his rifle and went out, ready to fall through the
ground. Red as a peony, Sotkin looked into the cold face of the
non-commissioner with almost pleading eyes. The non-commissioned officer,
having examined the equipment, took Sotkin to the middle of the line and put
him facing the camp....</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- That's right, - he said and looked at his watch, and then left.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin took “on his shoulder.” The soldiers, passing by him, threw
oblique glances - it was so strange to see Sotkin under the satchel. He,
pouring sweat, was suffering patiently and steadfastly; the sun was burning
intolerably, scorching the back of his head, and the heat was giving him a
nervous chill in his body, aching from the weight and unnatural position of his
arm. The gray-haired field-febel, smiling into his mustache, approached Sotkin,
looked openly and affectionately into his eyes, and said just as
affectionately:</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Two hours passed. Sotkin was released, he came to the tent and for a
long time, pretending to be looking for something, rummaged through the trunk,
avoiding talking to his comrades. His embarrassment passed only by evening.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>A day later there was shooting again, but this time - accidentally
or not - Sotkin hit four out of five. The soldier breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- You'll get into the first category, - monotonously told him,
passing in the chain, the platoon commander, - you'll go to the prize, you'll
get a watch.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>He was laughing, of course. Sotkin understood this, but only waved
his hand, thinking: “The dog barks, the wind carries it. Their eyes met for one
sly, mute moment, and it became clear to Sotkin that the non-commissioner would
definitely and cruelly hate him for whatever he did, bad or good - all the
same, because he was Sotkin.</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>- Let me see. - He brought the muzzle to his eyes, turning the other
end of the barrel to the sun, looked for a long time, saw that cleaned
perfectly, and so said:</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

here, look.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- If I say... - began the sergeant, trying to find an expressive,
long phrase, but stammered. - Clean it, clean it.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin wiggled the ramrod in the muzzle for about ten minutes, but
he already felt the voice of resistance rising in his soul. This day was
exceptionally unpleasant for him because in the morning he had lost money,
eight rubles, and in the evening a circumstance occurred that was unexpected
and abrupt.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Thirty soldiers, having supped, gathered in a circle and, under the
direction of the field-febel who had organized the entertainment, sang one
after another of soldiers' songs. Sotkin stood there listening. He had neither
ear nor voice, so, not taking part in the chorus, he was limited to the role of
a man of the audience. The hot-headed, hoarse field-felon, without a hat, in a
pink chintz shirt, stretching his arms over the crowd, fiercely threatened the
tenors, bulged the basses, and extinguished the so-called “woman's voices,” the
owners of which in all cases were stout men. It got dark, the lights of the
city glittered.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Sotkin, sing,” said the field-felon, when the song was over. - You
don't know how, do you?</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- That's right, I can't. - Sotkin smiled, thinking that the
lieutenant was joking.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Wait. - Feldfebel stepped out of the circle and, approaching the
soldier closely, scrutinized him from head to toe. - Learn. “Do-re-mi-fa...”
Well, repeat it.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- I don't know how, - said Sotkin, and suddenly, noticing that the
small eyes of the fieldfebel were fixed on him, became wary.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Well, sing,” he repeated languidly, half-closing his eyes.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin was silent.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- You do not want to, - said the fieldfebel, - I know, you're
suprotective. Execute the order.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Sotkin turned pale; at the same moment the field-felder also turned
pale, and both, looking into each other's eyes, sighed deeply. “So this number
will not pass for you,” thought the soldier.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- No way, I can not, Mr. Fieldfebel, - said Sotkin separately and,
after thinking, added: - Forgive me generously.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>A joyful, cheerful smile lit up the wrinkles of the brave servant.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Ah, Sotkin, Sotkin,” he said, sighing, shook his head sadly, and,
folding his hands on his prominent belly, looked around cheerfully. The
soldiers, having stopped singing, looked at them. - 'Come with me,' he said
dryly, no longer smiling, squinted his eyes and strode towards the town.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Excited, but not realizing what was wrong, Sotkin walked beside him.
Behind his back the chorus rang out. Not far from the camp stretched an old
trench, densely overgrown with briars and nettles; in the bushes of these
Fieldfebel stopped.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- They used to teach us like this,” he said, hitting Sotkin's face
with all his might; he did it not with his fist, but with the palm of his hand,
so as not to leave marks. Sotkin's head whipped from side to side. Stunned, he
instinctively covered himself with his hand. Fieldfebel, turning the soldier
abruptly by the shoulders, poked him in the neck with his fist, laughed and
calmly walked away. Sotkin stood motionless, almost unable to believe it had
happened. Both his cheeks burned with pain, his ears were ringing, and it hurt
to move his head. He picked up his fallen cap, put it on, and looked toward the
camp. The soldiers were singing “Oy, za gai, gai...”, and in the lighted doors
of the maritant's shop could be seen the non-commissioned officers drinking
tea. The tents were vaguely white.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- And you can't beat me,” said Sotkin aloud, turning to this
peaceful picture of military life. - I have not been beaten by the ears for a
long time,” he went on, ”I will not allow it, as you want me to.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>He sat for five minutes on the ground, swallowing tears and remembering
the disgusting touch of the fist, then snuck into the tent, covered himself
with his overcoat without undressing and began to think.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>There were two years of service ahead of him. During this time there
could be many more occasions for the superiors to get angry, and Sotkin, a man
who did not like to bear insults obediently, could, at last, get angry himself,
which usually led to even worse things. He knew from the stories of some of the
soldiers who had been hounded into hard labor, and it had taken place in this
sequence: light and dark punishment cell, punishment cell on trial,
disciplinary battalion, shackles. But it was hard to expect a change of wind.
Memories told Sotkin that the superiors, interrupting with the shout, “Hey you,
professor of sour soup, vaksa compiler, to prayer!” - some trifling story to
the soldiers about the Eiffel Tower, - uses his power not only for business
purposes, but also because it is power, a thing pleasant in itself, which is
even more pleasant to use aimlessly in relation to a man of mental strength.
There was great scope for everything in it.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>“I could ruin my life here, for that's what it's worth,” thought
Sotkin. Finally, having made a firm decision not to serve any longer, he fell
asleep. A day later, Sotkin was not at roll call in the morning. The
field-felon wrote a report, the company officer wrote to the regimental
officer, the regimental officer wrote to the district; a little more ink was
spent on correcting the food lists, and the town and district police noted,
scratching his back, in the lists of other fugitives and wandering people, the
burgher Stepan Sotkin.</span></p>

old acquaintance of Inna Sergeyevna's whom she had known as a gymnasium
pupil--Apollon Cheprakov, the zemstvo chief. He was a man with a bulging mouth
and the same fast-running eyes; he shaved his moustache, wore a dark beard with
a string like the strap of a helmet, had curly hair, and dressed, living in the
village, in sportsman's colored shirts, encircled on the stomach with a wide,
with chains and pockets, belt. Cheprakov's special, amazing property was his
ability to talk smashingly about anything, clinging to a single word. He stayed
at the estate for four days, looked after Evgenia Alexeevna and collected a
collection of butterflies.</span></p>

view, ruff, so to speak, free - one thing, a variety, and cooked, such as, for
example, now, - he picked a spoon fish - an object that requires onions and
peppers. Shchedrin wrote a fairy tale about ruff, and well, quite witty.</span></p>

turned, - you remind me of a fish swimming in the water.</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>The girl laughed. The big, frivolous Cheprakov made her laugh more
than angered her with his unexpected verbal shots. He met her strangely, too:
shaking hands, he suddenly said: “There are meetings and meetings. This is very
pleasant for me, I'm amazed,” and, shaking his head, strutted off. He spoke
loudly, as if he were reading from a book, not only to a deaf person, but to a
deaf-mute.</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>- Yes. Bursa mucosa. - Cheprakov looked tenderly at the girl and
repeated with emphasis: - Mukoza. I bowed my head under the blow of fate, but
recovered. This topic was enough for him for a long time. He named in detail
the doctors who treated him, medicines, prescriptions, remembered the sister of
mercy Pudikova and, having talked, got up from the table, continuing to
describe the hospital regime. Usually after dinner, if the weather was fine, Eugenia
went into the woods, which began behind the pond; the uncle, covering his face
with a handkerchief, lay down, saying from “Carmen”: “So that we are not
disturbed by flies” - and fell asleep in the study; Inna Sergeevna had a long
conversation in the kitchen with the cook about unknown things, and then went
to her room, where she fiddled at the mirror or dismantled antique lace, always
going to make something out of them. Cheprakov, taking a butterfly net, pins,
and a vial of ether, stood on the porch, waiting for the girl, and when she
came out, said:</span></p>

forest, headed along the path to the local landmark - the “Horse's Head” stone,

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Cheprakov's talkativeness paralyzed her; she noticed with
displeasure that she sometimes unconsciously imitated him in the turn of
phrase. His manner of speaking resembled an endless, annoying throwing of
bread-balls in his face. “Is he always and with everybody like that? - Eugenia
pondered. - Or draws? I do not understand.”</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The smell of pine needles, ants and mullein was sharp. The red
trunks of pines, slightly creaking, shook their tops. Cheprakov saw a tit.</span></p>

but nevertheless a touching phenomenon. - He glanced at his companion's thin
blouse, tightly fitting her round shoulders, and sharply felt a whiff of female
youth. His thoughts suddenly became confused, lost their annoying
chrestomaticity, and jumped uncertainly. He fell silent, rolling his eyes,
noting the fuzz on the back of his head, the thin hand at the brush, the mole
at the corner of his lips. “A pleasant girl, by God,” he thought, “and perhaps
still forbidden, yes.</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>- It's an honorary payment, a fee,” explained Cheprakov gravely. He
touched Eugenia's elbow with his fingers, saying: “You've got a twig stuck to
you,” though I came up with this twig after much thought. - Now,” he said
gravely, unconsciously getting into the right tone, ”what to say about me, I am
a small man, doing what fate has given me to do. You, how do you live? What do
you think, what do you dream of? What have you planned for your life? That is
what is more interesting to know, Evgenia Alexeevna.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Cheprakov himself did not know why he needed it; probably he had
changed his tone by unconsciously observing that shy people often say to
strangers what they would not always say to people closer to them, and why he
needed it, he did not know definitively.</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>They approached the stone. “What shall I say?” - Eugenia thought.
She did not know what Cheprakov imagined her to be, but she felt that she was
not what she really was. In this, as well as in the peculiar mood that comes
from the fact that sometimes a chance question gathers in a person's soul his
scattered cherished things into one whole, - there was a certain amount of
desire to tell about herself. Besides, for some reason she felt sorry for
Cheprakov, and it seemed to her that at last she could talk to him without
birds and Dionysus.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

                lang=EN-US>- You see, Apollon Semyonitch,” she began hesitatingly, sitting down
on the grass; Cheprakov, with his chin up, stood by the stone, ”I have two demands
in my life. I want, firstly, to earn the love and respect of people, and
secondly, to be in some great, very necessary and important business, and to
merge so closely with it that both I and the people and the business would be
one. Do you understand? However, I don't know how to express it. But I can't
find it, or I'm not good at it, I don't know. But it is difficult, isn't it, to
find something in which passions and personal interests and ambition are not
involved? It frightens me, I confess. Personal life should not be entangled
with anything, let it flow along a different course. Then I would live, as they
say, a full life.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- N-yes, - Cheprakov stretched out, sitting down next to me, - not
many, not many are given. I deeply respect you. And what do you say about the
main thing - the main enzyme of life? The sweet, the sweet, the sweet. in a
word, love?</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- 'Well, yes,' Eugenia dropped quickly, 'of course...' - She was
embarrassed and flared up, then, as if justifying herself and already angry
with herself for it, added: - 'After all, everyone is equal here, and men.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Of course they are! - Cheprakov said cheerfully. - Very much so.
The girl laughed.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>“And I, by God, I'll try,” thought Cheprakov, “young ... nineteen
years old... does not know life... - Then he continued to ponder, by habit, as
he said, in chopped phrases: - How interesting is the awakening of love in a
woman's heart. Down with the slogans of General Kuropatkin. My dear, you are
not indifferent to me. I'm coming to you.”</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

bursa mukoza was, eh? Look at it.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

                lang=EN-US>He quickly rolled up the pants on his left leg to the knee, exposing
a hairy calf and a white scar. Eugenia, suddenly cooled down, looked at
Cheprakov in surprise.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- This is a mucosa. - Cheprakov tightened his pants. - What white
skin ... and you, too... hand.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Eugenia looked at her hand and saw that this hand found itself in
Cheprakov's hand, he kissed it and pressed it to the left side of his chest.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Well, leave it, - calmly, but changed in the face, said Eugenia. -
Hands away.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- No - why not? - Cheprakov said naively. - It is sudden, deep. The
girl picked up the umbrella, turned and leisurely walked away. Cheprakov stood
still for some time, stiffly looking after her, then he yawned falsely, took
another path to the manor house, took a fishing rod and sat on the river until
dinner.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>At the table he avoided looking at Eugenia, and she at him; this the
aunt noted to herself. The next day in the morning Cheprakov left for the city,
having time to whisper goodbye to the silent girl:</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Eugenia held the letter in her hands, looking at the school,
half-masculine handwriting with bewilderment. At last, having lost hope of
guessing from whom the letter was from, for she had no acquaintances in the
district town, and the postmark on the envelope read: “Saburov,” the girl began
to read.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>- What, what is it? - she cried out in astonishment and resentment.
Holding the letter with a trembling hand, she bent to it, bewildered at the
surprise,-so much was there in it of deliberate malice, venom, and mockery.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

you that. Tell me how you're not ashamed. If you behave like that, then your

young lady. Though we're not married, we've been living together for four
years, thank God. And I won't let you take my man away from me. If you're in love

                lang=EN-US>Having read to the end, Evgenia Alexeevna dropped her hands and
looked around helplessly. A sickly, nervous laugh choked her. She did not even
at once realize from whom the letter was from. Separate phrases, and the most
offensive ones, one after another appeared before her in the air as on a
screen, overwhelming her with their imposing peremptoriness; it was like a
dream in which, wishing to escape from a terrible phenomenon, one cannot move
from one's seat. She even wondered whether it was not a hoax of the same
Cheprakoff, a crude, mad hoax, but a hoax nevertheless; but it was difficult to
think of anything like such a letter on purpose. The old fear of life seized
the girl, she guessed that man was fatefully defenceless in body and soul; and
even Siegfried, from head to foot covered with horny skin, had a spot on his
back, the size of a tree-leaf, that missed death. The whole sad and funny scene
of the third day, with the “bursa mukoza” and the kissing of hands, came to
life before the girl; a burning color of shame flooded her from head to toe at
the thought that - this was the most painful of all - her accidental frankness
was known to Maria Tikhonova in a suspicious transmission, acquiring a meaning
ridiculously shameful and causing, probably, giggles.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Eugenia was sitting upstairs alone, and this helped her to recover
from the offensive surprise. Had such a story happened five years later, she
must have treated it, outwardly, somewhat differently: either she would not
have answered the letter at all, or she would have written a calm, intelligible
reply. But at her present age she had not yet learned to weigh circumstances,
and continued to regard people closely and in great detail, to the end.
Tikhonova's address was in the letter; the author must have been guided by the
well-known curiosity of the summons. Evgenia Alexeevna looked at her watch: six
o'clock. Wishing to end personally and as soon as possible what she still
considered a misunderstanding, the girl, pinning on her hat and taking the
letter, went downstairs.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>She had four versts to cover on foot; there was no excuse for
telling her to harness a horse. She stepped out of the back porch into the
village, turned around to see if any of the household were following her, and
walked quickly toward the town, visible already from the nearest hill by the
red stain of the government liquor warehouse, white bell towers, and gardens.
Her excitement did not leave her, on the contrary: the nearer she came to the
dark fences of Saburov, the more intolerable the slowly shrinking distance
seemed. The girl was firmly convinced that she would force herself to listen
and that she would be given all the explanations she needed. At last she
entered the town. Eugenia had been here before. Stepping on the unsteady boards
of the sidewalks, thickly covered with nettles with their sharp, deafening
smell, the girl remembered one evening when, returning from a concert of a
visiting pianist at the hotel, where Pavel Pavlych was waiting for her to leave
together, she walked leisurely through the streets. The town was falling
asleep. The red and purple curtains were still glowing in some places; the
pigeons were gurgling sleepily in the high pigeon-house; the Sloboda burghers
were playing their last game of ruffles in the square; an old beggar, standing
in the darkness on the corner, was waving his hands, muttering inebriatedly;
from the open windows of the military chief's apartment a badly learned
“Virgin's Prayer” was being sung; the men, sitting on the bedside tables at the
inn, were gabbling about the rented meadows. The ravines smelled of the dampness
of the icy keys. The clear gleam of stars flowed over the black roofs. The
steamer “Ivan Luppov” stood at the wharf, throwing the murky light of its
lanterns into the flour piles; its mast lights against the black, like spilled
ink, shoals of the opposite shore seemed an illumination. She remembered this
peaceful silence, marveling at the deceptiveness of the silence, at its hidden
stings; she was even embarrassed to walk with her indignation among the small,
tidy, green houses, the shrivelled, flimsy shacks, the rustic dust, the
harmless yellow paint, and the slumbering mezzanines. Finding the house and
street, Eugenia, with a heavy nervous oppression that filled her with sudden
weariness, rang at the yellow front door. She was opened by a dejected pregnant
woman.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Is Mrs. Tikhonova at home? - Eugenia asked, and suddenly she
wanted to go away, but she overcame her fear. The woman, with her mouth open,
looked at her; it was ridiculous to the grave.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

                lang=EN-US>- They ask for you,” said the dull woman, returning after a long,
languid minute. She opened the door wide and stared at Eugenia, as if guarding
her with her gaze. The girl, taking a deep breath, entered a low room with
canaries, ivy, and Viennese chairs. At the farther door, crossing on her high
chest puffy, like buns, arms, stood a black-browed, pink-faced lady in a gray
hood.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Whom do I have the honor? - filtered the lady, examining Evgenia
Alexeevna. The girl spoke with difficulty.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- 'I am Mazalevskaya,' she said, clenching her fingers to restrain
her excitement, 'I want to ask you why you, without giving yourself the trouble
to.... Here is your letter. - She held out the sheet to the proudly smiling
Tikhonova. - Please explain everything to me, do you hear?</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- And what has labor got to do with it? - The lady spoke loudly,
moving her eyebrows suggestively. - And I have nothing to explain to you. And I
have nothing to say to you. And that Apollo is a pig in front of me, I know
that too. And if, believe me, my dear, a man says, “Ah, ah, ah, ah! She has an
inclination for me,” and if you lure a man with different matters, then, pardon
me, no; ah, leave it. I am not a girl to be led by the nose. And most of all
I'm surprised you even came; it's so modern, please.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The girl's legs trembled, she looked at Tikhonova with the look of a
stricken man and was confused.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Where is there to understand, - said the lady, - we - county.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Eugenia did not finish, turned, went out into the street and burst
into tears. Trying to restrain herself, she hastily pressed her handkerchief to
her mouth and eyes; she walked and stopped automatically; rare passers-by,
turning round, looked at her for a long time, and then transferred their eyes
to fences, trees, and roofs, as if it were there that the necessary explanation
was hidden; one said, shouting: “What's screwed up, hearty?” Having overcome
the spasms, the girl saw Cheprakov; he was crossing the street on his way to
Tikhonova's apartment. Not at all surprised that she had met this man by
chance, rather even with a sense of relief, Evgenia Alekseevna stopped him at
the corner. Cheprakov, having ceased waving his cane, took off his cap, turned
away, and blinked so anxiously that it was impossible to doubt that he knew
about the letter.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Cheprakov, giving himself away, remained silent, not saying hello,
not even pretending to be surprised to see Mazalevskaya in town.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Do you know about the letter? - The girl asked sternly. Cheprakov,
arching his back, spread his hands.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Evgenia Alexeevna looked intently into his hidden eyes, waved her
hand, and went out of town with the slow gait of a tired man.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Before going out to tea, Eugenia washed her face thoroughly with
cold water and went to the mirror. The traces of her recent disorder had
disappeared. Brushing her hair, wrapping herself in fluffy, below-the-knees
hair, the girl for the hundred and first time experienced this, indelible at
her age, but all the quieter, all the closer to calm sadness. She was no longer
indignant, but perplexed. There had been similar incidents in her shadowy life
before, but she had not formed a habit of them; she experienced them each time
with all her nerves; something like a fear of people had developed in her
gradually and imperceptibly. Even now she caught the sudden awakening of this
feeling.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- What is there to be afraid of? - Eugenia Alekseevna said aloud,
trying to understand herself. Memories figuratively showed her that people's
undeserved malice, gloating, and unconscious cruelty, from which no one is
protected, are terribly undeserved. She recalled several examples of this in
relation to herself and others.... Eugenia Alexeevna saw herself especially
clearly on the street of St. Petersburg and in the Crimea.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>On the street, approaching the girl, a man, imposing and stately
posture, stopped, hit her very hard with his fist in the chest and calmly
passed without even turning around. And in the Crimea, at the boarding-house
table, during dinner, a well-fed dapper merchant, still a young man,
resplendent with rings and diamonds, seeing very well that his words were
unpleasant and outrageous, spoke calmly of his thefts during the Japanese war,
addressing his mistress and his guide-friend. Once in a while he addressed the
others as well.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

wounded, and that money is in my pocket. Forty thousand.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Yevgenia Alexeyevna went downstairs and drank strong tea. She was
carrying on the usual, almost meaningless conversation with her relatives in a
casual way.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- 'Zheniechka,' said Inna Sergeyevna at the end, as if by accident,
'the day before yesterday Apollo ... it seemed to me. you didn't quarrel?</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Not at all. - She looked calmly at her aunt and smiled. It was
already dusk, when, wanting to be alone, Eugenia went around the pond full of
clouds. She walked along the edge of the forest, the twilight fields opened to
the left, under the sleepy blue sky that had lost its luster, the birds chirped
muffled in the woods, the lowered veil of semi-darkness hid its low daylight. A
corncrake twitched at the hedge. Eugenia stopped, she liked the desolate
silence of the neighborhood; she stood and thought.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

                lang=EN-US>- Go to bed,” said a voice behind her; ”though you are a woodpecker
and a working bird, yet take care of your strength.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>Mazalevskaya shuddered and turned to the invisible speaker. He could
not be seen, he was sitting or lying in the dark bushes.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Uncooperative,” continued the voice, ”at least you have learned my
language. A-m-m-me-me-ma-am, a-am, me-e. Crestfallen.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The voice was silent, and a man came out of the bushes with a bag
over his shoulders, in an old cartouche, laptoes, and with a club, like those
used by pilgrims; he wanted to jump the hedge, but, noticing Eugenia, threw off
his cartouche and held out his hand.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- A-m-m-m-me-me-ma-am-me-e,” he mumbled, pointing to his mouth.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Mute? - Eugenia asked.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The man nodded, looking expressively at the young lady's hand and
purse.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Though you are a working bird, - Eugenia said unexpectedly to
herself, holding out the change, - but take care of your strength.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Overheard, - suddenly said quite clearly imaginary mute and
grinned confusedly.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- I have a need,” said the man evasively.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- Don't be afraid of me,” said Eugenia, thinking. Her curiosity was
greatly hurt.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>The man looked around.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- So what, you are not interested, - he reluctantly spoke. - Just a
runaway soldier. Not a big bird. You see, I have a passport, I bought it
somewhere, but, pardon me, I can't lie. But at night, as you know, or on the
meadow, a man will give them a drink - they like to talk, they're interested in
passers-by. Well, you see, you can't lie, especially at a lodging. It's
dangerous. I ran away from one railroad guard; the old man started hunting for
me, you see, and what's in it for him? Of course, after thinking about it, I
pretended to be mute, and so I'm going. To Odessa. I have acquaintances there;
they'll arrange it for me. In a month, believe me, I haven't spoken a dozen
words with people, sometimes I talk to myself out of boredom; but I see you
won't do any harm,” I said.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>- I won't,” confirmed Eugenia absent-mindedly.</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
                lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

                lang=EN-US>Sotkin jumped over the hedge, waved his cartouche and walked,

        <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

man who hid himself from others would penetrate more and more deeply into the
life of others like himself, would understand more in detail the complex
confusion of the human soul. This was fermenting in her still vaguely, but
imperiously. She began to realize that in the great pain and hardship of life a
rare person was more interested in other people's “cherished” than in his own,
and so it would be until the “cherished” became common to all, while now it was
still a reproach and suffering for many. And the people to whom it is close
even now, in its light essence, can only be guessed, felt and overheard.</span></p>
